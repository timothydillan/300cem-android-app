### Background
Due to hurried creation of the video, several important features were not explained. Therefore, a technical explanation will be elaborated below to highlight some of the features that were not mentioned in the video.

### Features
- Allows users to share their location with their closest ones (circle).
- Allow users to view each other's health information.
- Allow users to view each other's mood information.
- Able to detect if a user has encountered a crash.
- Users are able to alert other members using the SOS alert feature.
- Users are able to edit their circle name.
- Users are able to create a new circle.
- Users are able to join an existing circle.
- Users are able to leave the circle that they are currently in.
- Users are able to edit their profile details.
- Users are able to remove their account.
- Users are able to turn on password and biometric authentication, so that other people using the user's device won't be able to view sensitive information.
- Users are able to pair their device with their wearables (if the wearable is using WearOS). So that the wearable is able to send data to their handheld device, users would need to first download this project, and change the configuration module to the circles_wear module, and then run the app. A video will be shown below.
